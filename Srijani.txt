My name is Srijani and I am an undergraduate. 
I registered for the free session on Git and GitHub by Hatch.Ed after a friend of mine told me about it and I am glad I did. 
The organizers and speakers made everything extremely easy to understand. 
Looking forward to participate in all of their upcoming events. 
Thank you!
